 1. Project Title : 
Attendance Tracking Logic using Pattern Code in Python. 
2. Problem Statement : 
To design and implement an attendance tracking system using Python 
that allows the user to mark students as Present or Absent and display 
attendance summary including total present, total absent, and 
attendance percentage. 
3. Objective : 
• To track student attendance using Python 
• To use loops and conditional statements 
• To apply dictionary data structure 
• To calculate attendance percentage 
• To understand basic logic building 
4. Tools Used : 
• Python 3 
• VS Code / IDLE 
5. Description : 
This project simulates a simple attendance tracking system. 
The user enters the number of students and marks each student as 
Present (P) or Absent (A). 
The program stores attendance using a dictionary and calculates total 
present, total absent, and attendance percentage. 
6. Algorithm : 
1. Start 
2. Read number of students 
3. Create empty dictionary for attendance 
4. Loop through each student 
5. Read attendance input (P/A) 
6. If input is P → mark Present 
7. Else → mark Absent 
8. Count total Present and Absent 
9. Calculate attendance percentage 
10. Display summary 
11.Stop 
9. Result : 
The attendance tracking system successfully records student 
attendance and calculates attendance percentage correctly. 
10. Conclusion : 
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build a simple 
attendance tracking system using loops, conditional statements, and 
dictionary data structure.
